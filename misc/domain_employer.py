# domain_employer.py
#
# This scripts is based on the outcomes of unifypeople.py.
# This will provide two tables: companies and upeople_companies
# And this is expecting a file with specific pattern: 'domain' 'employer'
# (similar to git-dm format to map domains to employers)
# if the domain is not found, that developer is assigned to unknown
# employer
