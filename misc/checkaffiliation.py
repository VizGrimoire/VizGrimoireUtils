# checkaffiliation.py
#
# Checks tables related to affiliation to companies:
# upeople_companies and companies
#
# General idea about the affiliation tables:
# Unique people (that is, individual persons, who could have several
# identities) are in upeople table.
#
# Companies are in companies table. In addition, that table also holds:
#  - Special company name "-Unknown", for people with unknown affiliation
#  - Special company name "-Bot", for bots
#  - Special company name "-Individual", for people known to work on
#     their own, not affiliated to any company
#
# The relationship between companies and upeople is in upeople_companies.
# This table has one entry per developer affiliated to a company during
# a certain period.
# Date "1900-01-01" means "since always" (no starting date)
# Date "2100-01-01" means "for ever" (no finishing date)
#
# This script looks for potential inconsistencies, such as:
# People in more than one company during the same period
#  (an special case is when one of the companies is "-Unknown",
#   for sure that's an error)
# People with no affilaition (not even -Unknown")
