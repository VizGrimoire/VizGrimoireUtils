# email_employer.py
#
# This script is based on the outcomes of unifypeople.py, domain_employer.py
# or domains_analysis.py and this needs a file with the pattern:
# 'email address' 'company' 'final date'
# This script basically updates information in upeople_companies.
#
# A basic assumption of this script is that this information does not
# previously exists. This means that information already there will be
# duplicated
