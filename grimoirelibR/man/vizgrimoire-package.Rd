  Making life easier to users of Metrics Grimoire tools, and vizGrimoireJS
}
\description{
  Metrics Grimoire tools extract information from software development
  repositories such as git or Bugzilla, and store it in an SQL
  database. This package assists in analyzing data from that database,
  with the aim of producing quantitative analysis of several software
  development aspects. Some of the analysis can be lated visualized with
  vizGrimoireJS (JSON files are produced with that aim).

The package provides several hierarchies of classes, each one oriented
towards a certain kind of analysis. Usually, analysis start with
retrieving some data from databases produced by Metrics Grimoire tools,
and as a result produce charts, JSON files and other output information.
