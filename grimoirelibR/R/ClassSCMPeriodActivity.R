## FIXME: Still wirting it, based in ITSMonthly

## Query for getting activity per author for a given period
## (format string, first %s is starting date for the period
## (period >= date), second % is the final date (period<date).
## Date in the "2013-01-26" format.

## Initialize, by running the query for the object
##  and returning the corresponding data frame.
##
## Rows produced by the query should include one called "id",
##  which must be, for each month, year*12+month, as integer
##
## Initialization fills in missing months, and adds some columns:
##  - year (as integer, XXXX)
##  - month (as integer, 1-12)
##  - date (as text, eg: "Feb 2012")
