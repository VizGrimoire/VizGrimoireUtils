## ITSMonthlyVarious class
##
## Class for handling various parameters related with tickets, per month
##
## This is the class that is usually instantiated to get a full monthly
##  dataset with information about the evolution of activities related to
##  tickets.

setClass(Class="ITSMonthlyVarious",
         contains="ITSMonthly",
         )

##
## Initialization is by merging objects of all the sister classes
##
## Therefore, this class is a way of getting a data frame with all
##  the relevant monthly parameters
